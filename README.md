# Data-Analysis - Advanced Programming Summative Assessment
Designes and developed a prototype application that demonstrates how data from the given data set can be formatted, reshaped and used to generate specific outputs.
Single Programme with the below functionalities:

￿ A means to load the initial data set (CSV file(s) provided) and translate it into
a suitable format – either XML, JSON or an entity relationship structure (not
CSV).
￿ A means to back up the suitable format using either files or a database. This
should preserve the current state of the data when the program is closed and
make it available when the program is reopened.
￿ A process for cleaning and preparing the data set, managing inconsistencies,
errors and missing values. Cleaning can be done at either the CSV stage or
after you have translated the data set into a new format and is required to be
done before you apply any of the data manipulations and outputs detailed
below.
A graphical user interface(s) for interacting with the data set(s) that enables
the user to:
o Load the initial data set (the CSV file(s)).
o Apply the cleaning, transformation, REMOVE and RESHAPE to
produce a prepared data set.
o Load the prepared data set (from its translated format).
o Manipulate the range of values used to generate OUTPUT STATISTICS,
GRAPHS and perform CORRELATION analysis.
o Use the prepared data set to generate OUTPUT STATISTICS, GRAPHS
and CORRELATION results.
