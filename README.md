# **Data Analysis - Advanced Programming Summative Assessment**

## **Project Overview**
This project involves the design and development of a prototype application that demonstrates how data from a provided dataset can be:
- **Formatted**
- **Reshaped**
- **Used to generate specific outputs**

The application is a single program equipped with the following key functionalities.

---

## **Features**

### **1. Data Loading and Transformation**
- Load the initial dataset (CSV file(s) provided).
- Translate the dataset into a suitable format:
  - Options: **XML**, **JSON**, or **Entity-Relationship Structure** (not CSV).

### **2. Data Backup**
- Preserve the current state of the dataset when the program is closed.
- Enable the dataset to be available when the program is reopened.
- Support for backup using:
  - File-based storage.
  - Database storage.

### **3. Data Cleaning and Preparation**
- Manage:
  - Inconsistencies
  - Errors
  - Missing values
- Cleaning can be performed:
  - At the CSV stage.
  - After transforming the dataset into the new format.
- Ensure data is cleaned before performing any manipulations or generating outputs.

### **4. Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
The GUI allows users to:
- Load the initial dataset (CSV file(s)).
- Apply **cleaning**, **transformation**, **removal**, and **reshaping** operations to produce a prepared dataset.
- Load the prepared dataset (from its translated format).
- Manipulate the range of values to:
  - Generate **output statistics**, **graphs**, and **correlation analysis**.
- View results for:
  - **Output statistics**
  - **Graphs**
  - **Correlation analysis**
